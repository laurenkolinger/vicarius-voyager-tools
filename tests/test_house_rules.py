"""
Module: tests/test_house_rules.py
Purpose: Police the VICARIUS prose rules over every Markdown file in this clone.
Inputs:  every *.md under the repository root, skipping environment, data,
         run and git directories.
Outputs: "PASS" on stdout and exit code 0, or one "file:line: reason" line per
         offence followed by a FAIL summary and exit code 1.

Rules checked, from the "Prose and console" section of
/mnt/rip/vicarius_drive/CLAUDE.md:
  - no em dash (U+2014) and no en dash (U+2013) in prose
  - never the banned verb or its forms, matched as whole words
  - no emoji code points

Text inside backtick code spans and inside fenced code blocks is skipped, so a
quoted parser syntax or a shell snippet never trips the sweep. The banned
literal is assembled from two adjacent string pieces so this file never
contains the contiguous word it looks for.

Usage:
    python3 tests/test_house_rules.py        # from the clone root, or anywhere
    pytest tests/test_house_rules.py         # the same check as a pytest case
